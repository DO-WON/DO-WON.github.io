          subtitle: "I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in Information Studies at University of Maryland. 
            <br/>
            I am advised by <a href=\"https://glciampaglia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#785EC4\">Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia</a> 
            and <a href=\"http://cody.bunta.in/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #785EC4\">Cody Buntain</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            My research interests lie at the intersection of computational social science and political science, 
            with a focus on understanding the complex interplay between human-algorithm feedback loops. </br>
            I investigate how social media algorithms shape users' exposure to diverse political content and how this, 
            in turn, influences their political attitudes and behaviors. 
            By leveraging computational methods and causal inference techniques, I aim to disentagle this reciprocal relationship. 
            </br></br>
            Through a deeper understanding of these feedback loops, my research sheds light on 
            how algorithmic curation and digital media consumption contribute to collective outcomes 
            such as political polarization, civic engagement, and the overall health of democratic processes.
            
            Ultimately, through my research, I seek to contribute to the development of platform design and 
            evidence-based policies that promote a healthy, inclusive, and democratically resilient online public sphere. </br></br>
