I am a computational social scientist using digital experiments and computational methods to design and test interventions for healthier, more democratic online information environments. I approach digital platforms—especially recommendation algorithms—as institutions that govern how attention is distributed, which voices are amplified, and how people engage with one another online. 

<br/><br/>
My dissertation addresses a core challenge in today’s information environment: the gap between what users say they value (stated preferences) and what their engagement behaviors suggest they value (revealed preferences). This gap matters because users often engage with low-quality, attention-grabbing content they don’t truly value. Engagement-based algorithms then amplify this content, distorting users’ information environments.

<br/><br/>
To address this, I develop a stated preference-based recommendation algorithm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to re-rank content based on users’ explicitly expressed values and test its effects on both individual and system-level outcomes through RCTs and large-scale simulations.

<br/><br/>
Beyond the dissertation, I have worked on a digital field experiment on Twitter/X to examine how muting low-quality accounts influences users’ information consumption and downstream political attitudes. I was also part of a finalist team in the Prosocial Ranking Challenge, where we designed and tested a recommendation algorithm aimed at fostering constructive, cross-partisan dialogue. In another collaborative project, I study how real-time political conversations can reduce affective polarization, using LLM-embedded experiments.
