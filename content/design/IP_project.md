I am seeking an undergrad/MA student for an hourly Research Assistant position for a social media study!

**Study Title**: Value-aligned social media algorithm for users aged 18-24: Bridging the gap between stated vs. algorithm-inferred preferences


**🎯 Focus**: Investigating the discrepancy between what young users say they want (stated preferences) and what algorithms infer they want (algorithm-inferred preferences) on social media.


**🍪 Quick thought experiment**: 
You're a college freshman, living away from home for the first time. You occasionally snack on chips. An AI-powered snack shelf in your dorm observes this behavior and infers you prefer chips. It keeps prominently displaying chips, making them hard to ignore. As a result, you end up consuming more chips than you intend or believe is good for you. This is eerily similar to how social media algorithms work to shape our information diets!


**Our research explores**:
1. How do social media users aged 18-24 perceive the discrepancies between the content recommended by algorithms (algorithm-inferred preferences) and what they explicitly state they want to see (stated preferences)?
2. What specific content characteristics contribute to any perceived misalignment between stated versus algorithm-inferred preferences among these young social media users?
3. What specific features, design elements, and value signals do young users consider when co-designing a social media feed that better aligns with their stated preferences and values?


**📋 You'll assist with**:
Conducting interviews with co-design activities
Assisting with data collection and organization

**🕒 Ideal for students interested in**:
- Social media's impact on information consumption
- User experience and algorithm design
