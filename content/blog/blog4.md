**Note:** Summarized by Claude 3.5 Sonnet based on my notes from reading the paper. For more details, please refer to the original paper. Highly recommended.

## 1. Sample and Recruitment
- [ ] Consider using social media platform's targeting capabilities for recruitment
- [ ] Evaluate the need for quota sampling or post-stratification
- [ ] Be cautious about claiming full representativeness of the sample
- [ ] Implement measures to prevent or detect link sharing

## 2. Intervention Design
- [ ] Choose appropriate intervention type:
  - My favorites are...
    - [ ] Encourage change in on-platform behavior
    - [ ] Manipulate participants' experience through platform features
    - [ ] Provide exposure to content off-platform (but consider trade-offs between control and ecological validity)
- [ ] If using advertisements, account for potential low attention from users

## 3. Data Collection
- [ ] Evaluate options for data collection (e.g., browser extensions, data donation)
- [ ] Consider scalability and potential experimenter demand effects of chosen method
- [ ] Plan for longitudinal data collection if possible

## 4. Statistical Power and Effect Sizes
- [ ] Anticipate potentially small effect sizes
- [ ] Plan for large sample sizes or exploit within-participant variation
- [ ] Consider using repeated-measure designs to increase power

## 5. Attrition and Compliance
- [ ] Develop strategies to minimize attrition
- [ ] Plan for potential non-compliance (e.g., reactivation in deactivation studies)
- [ ] Consider incentivizing compliance, but be aware of potential effects on results

## 6. SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) Violations
- [ ] Assess potential for interference between units
- [ ] If relevant, use cluster-randomized design or two-stage randomization
- [ ] Plan to measure or account for spillover effects

## 7. Platform Dynamics
- [ ] Consider potential unobservable actions by the platform
- [ ] Account for algorithmic responses to interventions
- [ ] Plan for potential equilibrium and long-run responses

## 8. Interpretation of Results
- [ ] Be cautious about generalizing results (partial vs. general equilibrium effects)
- [ ] Consider complementing experimental evidence with observational studies
- [ ] Plan for measuring long-term effects (e.g., using surrogate indices)

## 9. Ethical Considerations
- [ ] Ensure proper informed consent procedures
- [ ] Address privacy concerns in data collection and storage
- [ ] Consider potential negative impacts on participants' well-being

## 10. Replicability and Transparency
- [ ] Document all aspects of the experimental design and analysis
- [ ] Consider pre-registration of the study
- [ ] Plan for sharing data and code (within ethical and legal constraints)

Remember to review and adjust this checklist based on the specific context and requirements of your social media experiment.
